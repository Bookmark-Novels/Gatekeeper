/**
 * WorkButton represents a button that should be used
 * to execute some possible long-running work.
 *
 * WorkButton takes the property `job` which should be a
 * function that takes a callback function. The callback
 * function should be used to indicate to the WorkButton
 * that the work is done.
 *
 * When a WorkButton is clicked, the button becomes disabled
 * and its contents is replaced with a spinner. When the callback
 * passed to `job` is called, the button becomes enabled and its
 * contents is restored. You can also control the state of the button
 * by passing along a `working` property. The `working` property should
 * be passed within the parent's render method.
 *
 * If no `job` property is specified, this component's state will
 * be determined entirely by the `working` property.'
 *
 * Additionally, you may manually invoke the enable/disable
 * functionality by calling `WorkButton#enable` and `WorkButton#disable`.
